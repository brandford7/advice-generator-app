### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
_hover={{
          bg: "hsl(150, 100%, 66%)",
          boxShadow: "0 5px 30px hsl(150, 100%, 66%)",
